# InSpecStyle

This is a fork of [linter-rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop) meant as a starting place for the inspecstyle atom package, which applies style guide suggestions to InSpec code.


## TODO:

Minimize steps to utilize. Currently need `gem install inspecstyle` and to require it within `.rubocop.yml` with a `require` before it will work. Maybe with an `inspecstyle install` command?
